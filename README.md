# I decided to use Volta

As a Ruby and Ruby on Rails developer, I was used to install and manage Ruby versions with rvm or rbenv. I decided to use Volta in order to manage development environments for NodeJS projects.

> Similar to package managers, Volta keeps track of which project (if any) you’re working on based on your current directory. The tools in your Volta toolchain automatically detect when you’re in a project that’s using a particular version of the tools, and take care of routing to the right version of the tools for you.
